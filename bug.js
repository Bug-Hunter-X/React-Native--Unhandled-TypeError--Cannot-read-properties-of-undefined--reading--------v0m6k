This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This commonly happens when you render a component that uses state before the component has mounted, resulting in the state variable being undefined. For example, if you render a component before `useState` has had time to initialize the variable, you'll get this issue. This is especially prevalent during initial rendering or when dealing with asynchronous operations where the state hasn't been updated yet.
